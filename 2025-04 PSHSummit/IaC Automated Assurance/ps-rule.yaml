# Helps avoid processing unrelated files (like .json, .md, etc.).

configuration:
  # Tells PSRule to automatically expand (compile) Bicep files into ARM templates before analysis.
  # Equivalent to running 'bicep build' behind the scenes.
  # Required for directly analyzing .bicep files without needing to manually convert them to ARM.

# This tells PSRule how to bind input objects (like those from Bicep or ARM templates) to rules.
# resourceType and type help PSRule identify what kind of resource is being evaluated (e.g., Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts) and apply the correct rules accordingly.
